I want to build on top of solution 3-2.

In solution 3-3:
- Implement implicit user management using JavaScript.
- The user should not need to type a user ID.
- The app should automatically generate a unique ID for the user if one doesn't exist in their browser.
- The app should use this ID to store/retrieve data.
- Keep the existing functionality (voice, structuring, analysis).
- the data file shall be kept maximum 30 day for each user
