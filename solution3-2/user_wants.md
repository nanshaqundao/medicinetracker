solution 3-1 is good already for personal use
however, if more than 1 people is using it, then the data mainly stored in the files will be a problem. as it is shared between users.

I want you to build on top of solution 3-1 and make a new solution under solution 3-2.

In solution 3-2, 
   - allow multiple users to use the app
   - each user has their own data
   - i do not want explictly a user management system here
   - no login required
   - no use of database as i want to keep it light
   - the solution 3-1 is on python and gradio, if you think you want to use other tech stack, fine.
